#backend development report

## SparkSQL issues
- Lack of support for `create temporary table tbl as ...` forces ad hoc management of temporaries
- dots not supported in names even with quoting.
- case insensitive
- lack of support of ant-joins, set ops



## dplyr issues
- difficult to add a new win fucntion
- mistakenly incomplete src_translate_env difficult to track down; maybe better defaults?
- had to rewrite INSERT INTO for only small diff from other dbs
- had to rewrite join lack of USING clause
- had to rewrite semi-join because of small syntax difference
- lots of rewriting in joins, reasons starting to fade from memory
- monkey patch for outer, unique_name (no longer needed) and n_distinct (nice to have)
- rewrite _mutate for seq eval
_ rewrite _filter to support new col in expression (aka HAVING)
- boilerplate for missing capabilities like commit and rollback


*rewrite*  means that I had to duplicate a chunk of code which may represent a maintenance burden in the long run. Unfortunately it was not clear and in most cases it seemed impossible to extend the original behavior using NextMethod. The custom code is not a lot but is stuck somwhere in the middle of the parten class method. So unfortunately there is code duplication between dplyr and dplyr-spark
